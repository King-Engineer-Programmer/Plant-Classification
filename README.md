# Plant-Classification ( in progress)

In this project I will use a k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) to associae plants with each other based on the dimension that are given. This is a full stack apllication where the model will be accessed via an API and the data will be stored in an Azure Database and connected to Tableau for analysis.
